# Admin Section Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the admin section of the Mindscraft website. The admin section has been redesigned to work without authentication for development purposes, allowing for easier content management.

## Pages

The admin section includes the following pages:

1. **Dashboard** - Overview of website statistics
2. **Posts** - Manage blog posts
3. **Projects** - Manage portfolio projects
4. **Team** - Manage team members
5. **Media** - Manage media files
6. **Analytics** - View website traffic and performance metrics
7. **Settings** - Configure website settings
8. **API** - Manage API endpoints

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Removal

Authentication has been temporarily removed from the admin section as requested. This was done by:

1. Removing the session check from `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`
2. Removing sign-out functionality from the Sidebar and MobileHeader components
3. Updating the dashboard page to work without a user session

### Content Management

The admin section now includes basic content management functionality:

#### Posts Management
- View all posts in a table format
- Add new posts with a form
- Edit and delete posts (UI only, backend implementation needed)
- API endpoints for fetching and creating posts

#### Projects Management
- View all projects in a card grid
- Add new projects with a form
- Edit and delete projects (UI only, backend implementation needed)
- API endpoints for fetching and creating projects

#### Team Management
- View team members in a card grid
- Currently uses dummy data as there's no Team model in the database schema
- UI for adding, editing, and deleting team members (backend implementation needed)

#### Settings
- Forms for managing general settings, SEO settings, and social media links
- Currently uses default values as there's no Settings model in the database schema

#### Analytics
- Displays dummy analytics data
- Placeholder for integration with Google Analytics or another analytics provider

## Database Schema

The current database schema includes:

- **User** - For authentication (currently not used)
- **Post** - For blog posts
- **Project** - For portfolio projects

To fully implement all features, additional models would be needed:

- **Team** - For team members
- **Settings** - For website settings

## Future Improvements

1. **Re-implement Authentication** - Add secure authentication when ready for production
2. **Complete CRUD Operations** - Implement update and delete functionality for all content types
3. **Add Team Model** - Create a database model for team members
4. **Add Settings Model** - Create a database model for website settings
5. **Implement Analytics Integration** - Integrate with Google Analytics or another analytics provider for real-time data
6. **Implement API Functionality** - Add actual API endpoints and authentication

## How to Use

1. Navigate to `/admin/dashboard` to access the admin section
2. Use the sidebar navigation to access different sections
3. Add, edit, or delete content as needed

## Technical Notes

- The admin section is built using React and Next.js
- Styling is done with Tailwind CSS
- Forms use client-side validation and submit data to API endpoints
- API endpoints use Prisma to interact with the database
