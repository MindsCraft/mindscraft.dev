# Prisma Seed Notes

## Issue Resolution

This document explains how we resolved the issue with running the Prisma seed script in an ES module environment.

### Original Issue

When running the build process, the following error occurred during the seeding step:

```
TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]: Unknown file extension ".ts" for J:\WorkSpace\Ongoing\mindsCraft.dev\prisma\seed.ts
```

This error occurred because the project is configured to use ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json), but ts-node had difficulty handling TypeScript files in this environment.

### Solution

We resolved the issue by:

1. Converting the seed.ts file to seed.mjs (JavaScript ES module)
2. Updating the package.json configuration to use node instead of ts-node

#### Changes Made:

1. Created a new seed.mjs file with the same functionality as seed.ts
2. Updated the prisma:seed script in package.json:
   ```json
   "prisma:seed": "node prisma/seed.mjs"
   ```
3. Updated the prisma.seed configuration in package.json:
   ```json
   "prisma": {
     "seed": "node prisma/seed.mjs"
   }
   ```
4. Removed the original seed.ts file

### Benefits

- Simplified the build process by removing the dependency on ts-node for seeding
- Eliminated the TypeScript compilation step for the seed file
- Ensured compatibility with the project's ES module configuration

### Alternative Approaches Considered

We initially tried:
1. Adding a ts-node specific tsconfig.json in the prisma directory
2. Using the --esm and --project flags with ts-node

However, these approaches did not resolve the issue, which is why we opted for the JavaScript ES module approach.
